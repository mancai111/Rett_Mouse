# Rett_Mouse
Using the movement data and neuron data to study Rett and non-Rett mice's moving behaviors.

# Main Code File Descriptions
### Codes of Main Contents that are in the presentation & report
Heatmap Construction: Code for Method of heatmap visualization analysis of mice's moving behaviors

Neuron Act Levels + Paw Displacement Velocities: Code for calculating paw displacement velocities, aligning neuron activity levels with velocities, conducting relevant analysis and attempting modeling phase

Statistics CSVs + Histograms + Moment Analysis: Code for Retrieving statistical data from heatmap, building the histograms, illustrating the moments of statistics

# Other Code Files 
### Codes of Extra Explorations, Informal Trials, Standup Discoveries, etc that are not in the presentation & report

Other_Individuality: Code for comparing each mouse's moving trend of every speed to the 0 mm/s (reference) to learn the mouse individuality throughout the training days

Other_ Sketch of Neuron Act + Paw Displacement: Code for trying another way of calculating velocity (next frame coordinate - previous frame coordinate = current velocity)

Other_Std and mean of all coords at all speeds of all mice: Code for learning all Rett and Non-Rett daily mean and std of movement coordinates

Other_Original Design of Heatmap: Code for original heatmap design (with reversed axis tick settings and unscaled)

# Data Storage
Some example files are provided in the repository's folders (included those are used in poster, presentation, and report)
